### Deep Learning: Building CNN to recognize monkey species from disparate images
I completed this project as part of an assignment in one of my modules during my Masters. The project involved building a deep convolutional neural network model to recognize monkey species from disparate images. [The monkey species classification tasks from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species/home) involved identifying ten species of monkeys from disparate image types. My task was to build an accurate classification model for this scenario using different CNN models. I first trained the LeNet type CNN model, then replaced the convolutional layers with the VGG-16 model (pre-trained on the Image Net dataset) and improved accuracyâ€”weighted average accuracy score: 0.72.

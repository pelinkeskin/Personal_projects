### Kaggle ConnectX RL Competition
This folder contains my submission for the [Kaggle ConnectX Reinforcement Learning competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/connectx/overview). The ConnectX competition involves training an AI agent to play Connect4, and contestants are required to submit their agent in a Python file for evaluation on the leaderboard. This leaderboard is updated dynamically to include scores from all submissions. Within the ConnectX_LeaderScore_Apprx300.ipynb notebook, I have developed an AI agent that currently holds a position of approximately 300 on the leaderboard. The agent was trained using the Stable_baseline3 PPO algorithm for 1 million timesteps in the Gymnasium environment, with linear learning-rate decay. I have created a function that enables dynamic prediction of the agent's actions by passing trained action network parameters (transforms, weights, biases) to an equivalent deep neural network developed using PyTorch that returns predictions. This notebook is currently bronze rated, publicly available and open for comments on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pelinkeskin/deep-rl-with-stable-baseline3-and-gymnasium-ppo).

### Implementing a small Database Management System with Bash
I implemented a small database management system in Bash for one of my modules during my Masters. Data exchange between client and server for data entry and query provided through pipes. The system supported concurrent execution and protected against synchronization problems with the effective use of semaphores. The system was able to create a database, create a table, insert rows in tables at existing databases and allowed to query the tables at targeted databases as a whole or with column indexes to display content.

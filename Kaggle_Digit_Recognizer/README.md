### Kaggle Digit Recognizer Competition
This folder contains my submission for the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer), which entailed the accurate identification of digits from a dataset comprising tens of thousands of handwritten images. My primary objective in this competition was to refine my skills in utilizing TensorFlow for training Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the context of image classification tasks. I successfully achieved an accuracy exceeding 99% with my model, securing a position in the top 30% of participants. My network architecture consisted of four convolutional layers and two fully connected layers, inclusive of the output layer. To address the classification challenge, I employed one-hot encoding for the labels, employed categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, and made predictions based on the class with the highest probability. After conducting empirical testing, I opted for the Adam optimizer over RMSProp due to its superior performance. To further enhance the robustness of the model, I integrated dropout and early stopping mechanisms to mitigate overfitting. Additionally, I introduced a learning rate decay on plateaus to achieve improved convergence during training. I am pleased to share that this notebook is publicly accessible on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pelinkeskin/cnn-with-tensorflow-practice) and welcomes comments and feedback from the community.

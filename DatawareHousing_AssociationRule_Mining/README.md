### Designing a Data Warehouse & Association Rule Mining using SQL and Python
I completed these tasks as part of an assignment in one of my modules during my Masters. This folder contains two notebooks; In Data_Warehousing_practice.ipynb I created a database and made a set of OLAP queries to explore the data. Then I defined a fact constellation schema diagram for the data warehouse with facts, dimensions, and measures and addressed steps for specific OLAP operations to perform  to answer a particular query. Then use PostgreSQL Python and its libraries and define a set of functions to operate the data warehouse. In Association_Rule_Mining_Practice.ipynb,  I cleaned and transformed an online retail dataset for association rule mining, then mined association rules using Apriori and FP-growth algorithms.

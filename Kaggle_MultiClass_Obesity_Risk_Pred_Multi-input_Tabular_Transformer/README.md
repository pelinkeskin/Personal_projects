### Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk Competition
This folder contains notebooks I submitted to the [Kaggle Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2). The aim of this project was to predict obesity risk, a factor related to cardiovascular disease, using a combination of various factors. The notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations and a deep neural network (DNN) model. The synthetically generated dataset had minor construction errors, so extensive feature engineering was not performed. Due to the small dataset size, I utilized exhaustive feature selection (EFS), though it was somewhat redundant given the attention mechanism of transformers and DNN's potential for L1 regularization. The same pipeline was used for an XGBoost model submitted to the same competition, where feature selection proved beneficial. In this notebook, I developed a multi-input tabular transformer model, inspired by the Keras example but using one-hot encoding for categorical features instead of training word embeddings. To address overfitting due to the small data size, Gaussian noise was added to numeric features for further regularization. While the transformer performed decently among other DNN models, it was outperformed by XGBoost and LightGBM model ensembles. This notebook is publicly available and open for comments on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pelinkeskin/dnn-multi-input-tabular-transformer).

### Kaggle Titanic ML Competition
This folder contains notebooks I submitted to the [Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). Titanic competition is about developing a model that makes binary classifications from tabular data of Titanic's passengers.  Kaggle_Titanic_Ensembles(Top_6%).ipynb was my first notebook, and I achieved a ranking within the top 6% with a 0.79425 leader score by using an Ensemble of SVC, RFC, XGBoost, and CatBoost classifiers. Kaggle_Titanic_Final_RFC_SVC_XGB.ipynb is my second notebook. I used RFC, XGB and SVC classifiers and my SVC in this notebook managed to get a 0.79186 leader score. I performed extensive data exploration with visualization and feature engineering in my second notebook. I used a combination of statistical and wrapper methods for feature evaluation and selection. I utilized gridsearchcv with an exhaustive feature selection to finalize feature lists and determine starting parameters for the models. This notebook is publicly available and open for comments on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pelinkeskin/randomforest-supportvector-xgboost).

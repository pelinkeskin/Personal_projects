<p>This repository contains small projects I do at my free time.</p>
<strong>JobAdsWordFreqEval:</strong> <br />
Small-scale text analytics study to assess word frequencies across data analytics job ads at linkedin which is useful for gaining some insight about what are the common traits employers currently looking for data analytics roles.   <br />
<strong>Time-Related_Feature_Engineering:</strong> <br />
This in this notebook I built Time-Related Feature Engineering Pipelines with Python to predict traffic volumes for ML course assignment during my Cs Masters.  I performed time related feature engineering by encoding time features using cyclic_spline_transformer, used wrapper strategy with sequential forward selection for feature selection and built a predictive model using Stochastic Gradient Descent regression with polynomial transformation and archeived 85% accuracy at predicting traffic volumes.

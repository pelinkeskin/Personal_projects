### Kaggle Forecasting Mini-Course Sales Competition
This folder contains my submission for the [Kaggle Forecasting Mini-Course Sales competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e19). This competition involved forecasting sales with synthetically generated time series datasets. Unfortunately, [This post](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e19/discussion/425538) revealed that this dataset had data construction errors on the test set which is being used to calculate the leaderboard scores. Such that, all countries had different base levels for the target feature at the train set but the same base level in the test set. There was no way to predict this other than probing the public leaderboard and no way to adjust to this other than shifting predictions up and down to match flawed test data. I shifted my predictions because that would no longer be predictive modelling, but some contestants did to score high on the leaderboard. As a result, while the leaderboard scores might be unreliable in assessing the performance of the developed models, I enjoyed practicing time features engineering and experimenting with Prophet and CatBoost for forecasting with time-series data. This notebook is publicly available and open for comments on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pelinkeskin/prophet-catboost-ensemble)
